# Overview and Objectives
A car reseller company is planning to launch a marketing campaign targeting potential buyers. The project aims to develop a classification model to predict if an existing customer will re-buy a new car or not.

The project consists of 2 main phases:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, which includes statistical descriptive, univariate analyis, bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis.

2. **Developing Machine Learning Models**: The project developed and bencmarked various models to classify whether a customer will rebuy a car or not based on their available information such as demographic and historical data.

By applying a data-driven approach to predict whether a customer will rebuy a car or not, the company can benefit from:

1. Focusing on the right potential customers, which help in increasing sales and ROI (return on investment).

2. Saving necessary costs and resources needed for non-potential customers.

3. Enhanced Customer Relationships by understanding their needs and preferences.
